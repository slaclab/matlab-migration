Check out matlab 
	CVSROOT should have been set in your login, but you can check it.
	It should be: :ext:<YOURAFSUSERNAME>@lcls-prod02:/afs/slac/g/lcls/cvs

	Chage dir to somewhere where you can do development, eg
        cd ~/greg/dev/lclscvs
	
	cvs co matlab/src

cvs add new file:
	cvs add xalsetup.m

cvs status. Eg to check that you're not going to overwrite someone
when you commit, if you commit the whole dir.
	cvs status
     or cvs status | awk '/Status/&&!/Up/'

cvs update, to merge any changes other people made with yours:
	cvs update
 
cvs commit when done:
	cvs commit -m 'comment' xalsetup.m

Go update the production:
	cd /usr/local/lcls/tools/matlab/src
        cvs status | awk '/Status/&&!/Up-to-date/'
	chmod +w *  [1]
	cvs update
	chmod -w *  [1]
	cd

For an initial checkout to production (for a new file):
	cd /usr/local/lcls/tools/
	cvs co matlab/src/<your file>
	chmod -w matlab/src/<your-file>  [1] 


[1] Note, this may fail with permission denied on files which were 
previously created (eg cvs co) with the "other" username (softegr or physics).
We do't have too much consistency right now.
